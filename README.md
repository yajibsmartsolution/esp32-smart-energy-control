# ESP32 Smart Energy Control System

## Project Overview
The ESP32 Smart Energy Control System is an IoT-based solution designed to enable
intelligent monitoring and control of electrical appliances using low-cost embedded
hardware and relay-based automation.

The system focuses on **energy efficiency, reliability, and adaptability**, making it
suitable for homes, offices, and small facilities—particularly in regions with
unstable power supply and growing demand for smart energy management solutions.

## Problem Statement
Many homes and small facilities lack affordable systems to:
- Monitor and control electrical loads efficiently
- Reduce unnecessary power consumption
- Integrate backup or solar power systems
- Automate appliance operation without complex infrastructure

This project addresses these challenges using an **ESP32-based embedded control
architecture** that is simple, scalable, and cost-effective.
